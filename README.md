# PiUpdateNotifier
Adds some update notifier functionality back to the Raspberry Pi.  Source grabbed from the update-notifier-common Ubuntu GNOME package found here https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy-updates/gnome/update-notifier-common.

## Installation
Run the `install.sh` script which then places all the files in their correct directories and starts the services. If you'd prefer to not use the install script, just move all the files in the filesystem similarly to how they sit in this repo, then start the timer service.
